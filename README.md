# Code-Generator
Description:

This website takes the user to a page where they can receive a 
randomly generated password everytime they hit the 'Generate Password' button at the bottom. A random string of characters will then appear in the large text box where the placeholder phrase "your secure password" current sits. 

Specifics: 

When the user hits the 'Generate Password' button; they will be presented with a series of questions that will dictate the type and length of the password. (Eg "how many charcters, want to include uppercase, special characters, numbers? etc.") The user will type in the number of characters they want as long as it is between 8 and 128 characters. Then they will say okay or cancel for the type of characters they want to include. Once questions are answered, and given the user has requested a password with at least one type of presented characters that are between 8-128 characters long, a random password will be generated and placed in the text box. This will all occur each and every time the user hits the Generate Password button.
